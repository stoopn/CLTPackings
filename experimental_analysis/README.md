1 - to open experimental data corresponding to rounded cysts

run rounded_cysts.m

2 - to open experimental data corresponding to flat cysts

run flat_cysts_2.m

3 - to visualize histograms of 1D descriptors for both flat and rounded cysts 

run histogram_1d_descriptor.m

4 - to visualize the probability distribution of K1 with the probability of actual measurements 

run Probability_of_single_occupancy_K1.m

5 - to visualize the diversity of adjacencies of rounded egg cysts

run diversity.m
